# Introduction

**Front End Development Tool** is a software application which helps web developers to build attractive, designer website layouts with ease and provide them ability to debug and test the code and interface of the website or application they're creating.

These tools can provide wide range of templates to interact with browser components, including prepared code that programmers can use to fix common programming tasks.

Frontend Frameworks are CSS frameworks and packages having pre-written, standardized code in folders and files. Their purpose is to assist in development by providing standard, low-level functionality so that developers can focus efforts on the other elements that make the project unique. This increases software reliability, speeds up programming time and simplifies testing.

The top three frontend frameworks of 2022 are **React , Angular and Vue.**

## React

React. js framework developed by **Facebook**, is an *open-source* JavaScript framework and library used for building user interfaces. React code can be written directly in HTML.

React specializes in creating UI components and enhancing client user experience. It is light as it eliminates the need to use extra elements like plugins. React instead of using two-way binding, intentionally prefers use of explicit updates.

Components with build feature that manages  its own state form basics to create such complex UIs.  Since component logic is written in JavaScript, rich data can easily be passed through the app and keep state out of the DOM.

Netflix, Instagram, Dropbox websites are created using React.

## Angular

Angular is led by the **Angular Team at Google**  and a community of individuals and corporations. It is a platform and TypeScript-based *free and open-source* web application framework. Angular is built by the same team that built AngularJS.

Angular specialized in building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.  It can also be used for creating web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop websites. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you can be easily imported into applications.

Angular meets huge data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model. You can even extend the template language with your own components as well as use a wide array of existing components.

Angular is preferred if your application is enterprise-grade and you need to incorporate complex functionalities like single-page,  progressive and native web apps.

## React vs Angular

|| React |Angular |
|---|--|--|
|**Data binding** | One-way data binding | Two-way data binding |
| **Speed** | Faster |Slower| 
|**Bundle Size** | Smaller | Larger |
|**DOM** | Virtual | Real |
|**Learning Curve** |  Moderate | Steep |
| **UI Rendering** | Server Side Rendering |Server Side Rendering |
| **Concept** | bring HTML into JS Works | bring JavaScript into HTML Works |


React is preferred over Angular due to it's virtual DOM implementation and rendering optimizations. Additionally, migrating between React's versions is quite easy. Unlike as in Angular, here you don't need to install updates one by one. To top off, React provides developers with  countless existing solutions that they can use.

## Vue

Vue is an open source JS framework built by Evan You, for building interactive user interfaces. It uses the model-view-viewmodel architecture, basically ensuring that logic is independent of the view so that things are clearer and legible. Vue pays good attention to the view layer of the application, and then works with supporting libraries for other additional functionality leaving the core light in size. 

Vue makes unit testing pretty easy. It is very flexible, and the docs also are the easiest to read among all JS frameworks out there. It is also super easy to get started with. Vue is one of the few frameworks that is very popular but not managed by any big corporations.

## Conclusion
React and Angular are both some of the best front end frameworks to use. While deciding the right framework for your application, few things to keep in mind -
- Core features 
-  Available tools
- Ease of integration
- Performance
- Learning curve
